# Breast-Cancer-Analysis
## Description
Breast Cancer is serious disease for woman. According to some research, in 2022, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 670 000 deaths globally. This is nearly 30 percent of woman deaded after knowing that they are possitive with breast cancer. 

In this report, we consider the status and effect of the disease on North Ireland. The dataset is from Queen's University Belfast Cancer Research.

We occured that the dataset is quite biased to certain group of woman, so it can lead to some unrealistic results in this region. Despite that, me and my team learned valuable skills like preprocessing data, making descriptive statistics report, doing statistical inferences, and choosing the appropriate model for evaluating and forcasting. 

## How to run
Put file main.Rmd and BRCA.csv in the same folder in RStudio.

Before running, click your mouse on line 5. Then you just need to press the combination of Ctrl + Alt + N to run each batch of codes.

To view the dataset, you can choose the play button on the environment section, which is on the top right of the RStudio. 

The result will be display right after the code section, or on the terminal.
